# MovieLens Analysis
HarvardX  |  PH125.9x  |  Capstone pt. 1 - MovieLens

Inspired by the Netﬂix Challenge, the goal of this project was to build a predictive model for movie ratings based on a dataset provided by GroupLens - a research lab from the University of Minnesoa. The data set includes 10M+ movie ratings, spanning more than 60,000 users and 10,000 movies.

Initial data handling and partitioning were performed per HarvardXPH125.9 course instructions. Subsequently, the data were checked for missing values to ensure integrity, a test set was generated, and exploratory data analyses were performed. Data visualization and feature engineering guided linear model development. Four models were evaluated, with ﬁnal model accounting for movie, user, and temporal eﬀects. This model produced was reasonably predictive, producing an RMSE of 0.866 when evaluated on new (validation) data.
